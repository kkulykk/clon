<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The project is an attempt to create an Rclone analogue. Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It is a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage interfaces. Over 40 cloud storage products support rclone including S3 object stores, business & consumer file storage services, as well as standard transfer protocols. Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands `rsync`, `cp`, `mv`, `mount`, `ls`, `ncdu`, `tree`, `rm`, and `cat`. It is used at the command line, in scripts or via its API.

In our implementation, called Clon (pronounced s-lon) we aimed to focus on intuitive command line interface with less configurable settings. As a result, we built a command-line tool to easily manage data on cloud storage and transfer files between local and remote storage instances.
